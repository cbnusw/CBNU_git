# XmlSimple - Easy API to maintain XML (especially configuration files)

I have translated the original Perl version of this module (XML::Simple)
to Ruby, because I often have to work with XML files, and the approach
of XML::Simple was one of the best I have ever seen. It only provides
two functions (xml_in and xml_out), that let you convert XML strings into
a nice memory structure and vice versa.

For further information and a really nice tutorial, have a look into the
doc directory of the distribution.
